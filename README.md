### Class 1 (30 Dec 23):

#### a) Class Summary

The speaker has nearly 19 years of experience in software programming, having worked with various languages and developed software used globally. They highlight the challenge of technology evolving rapidly, making it essential for programmers to adapt.

The importance of tying technology to business goals is emphasized, citing examples of banks still using old software. The discussion turns to learning Python for AI and delves into brain function, particularly the hippocampus and working memory.

The speaker advises short breaks during learning sessions to aid memory consolidation. They also discuss the two modes of brain thinking: focused and diffuse. The importance of sleep for memory consolidation is emphasized.

The speaker recommends reading the entire exam before starting to engage both thinking modes. Finally, they stress the significance of emotional stability for creativity and provide information about accessing class materials and videos.

The sessions will use an online compiler called Repl.it.
Understanding of computers, binary, CPU, and basic computer knowledge is important for a comprehensive programming experience.
Distinction between high-level languages (like Python) and low-level languages (like Assembly Language) – high-level languages are easier for humans but harder for computers.
Assembly Language example explained – involves memory addresses, loading values, and storing results.
The role of an assembler in translating Assembly Language to machine code.
The difference between compilers and interpreters – compilers create an executable file (e.g., .exe), while interpreters run the code directly and are helpful for troubleshooting.
An example of Python code with user input and arithmetic operations, demonstrating the need to convert strings to integers for mathematical operations.
The willingness to adjust the lesson speed based on the learner's comfort and pace.
